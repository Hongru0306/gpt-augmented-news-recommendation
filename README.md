This repository is the official implementation for the paper: **News Recommendation with Category Description via Large Language Model**. 

In this study, we proposed a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate descriptive texts for news categories, which are then applied to enhance news recommendation performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a 5.8% improvement in performance compared to baselines.
